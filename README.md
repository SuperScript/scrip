# scrip

This repository contains scripts that have proven useful over time, and routines to construct programs from them. The goals is to facilitate easy and self-contained reuse of these routines in scripts, with a common source maintained in one place.

Script inclusion is indicated by a line of the form `#include filename`. In the initial version this is the only form. In future versions additional comment conventions may be added.

# AI Describe a program that resolves these include statements recursively
# AI Indicate that the actual file content is included only for the first statement encountered that includes the file.
# AI! Extend this description with some simple examples.
